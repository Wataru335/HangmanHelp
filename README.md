## Hangman Game

This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Go. The game reads a list of words from a file, randomly selects one word, and prompts the player to guess the word letter by letter or the entire word. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly.

## How to Play
You have three words list files, each containing a list of words for the hangman.

>   words.txt, words2.txt, words3.txt

To play Hangman you need to run the Go script with this command : 

> go run main/main.go `<the name of the words.txt file you want>.`
